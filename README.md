 CSV ( Comma, Seperated, Values )

 - Make a variable for table then add table to preload function -- loadtable( 'name on file', 'csv', 'header')

I love to visit second hand stores regulary, so I've made a visual representaion of the things I have found over the last 5 weeks.
As a reflection of this Sketch I would have liked to have had one 'graph' with all the images and objects found over the 5 weeks instead of 4 differnt ones.
